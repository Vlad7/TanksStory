As I have some experience in software development on .net platform, I would like to create a small project, and it so happened that the choice fell on the creation of a simple 2D game named "Tanks". This game is written in C#, with WPF to create the user interface of the game.

The process of creating the game includes both the creation of the simple game engine and game development directly on it.

2D game engine should provide such functional:

  - cernel with timer;
  - input controller tracking;
  - collision handler;
  - graphic rendering of game objects;
  - map generator integrated with TiledEditor(tiled map reader);
  - network part;
  - achievements counter;

Over time, the list of requirements will be refined..

So, let's start it!
